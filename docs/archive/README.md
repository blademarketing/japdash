# Archived Documentation

This directory contains the original documentation files that have been superseded by the new organized documentation structure.

## Archived Files

- **PROJECT.md** - Original comprehensive project documentation (now split into multiple focused docs)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Original deployment guide (replaced by docs/guides/deployment.md)  
- **jap.md** - JAP API documentation (integrated into docs/api/external-apis.md)

## Migration

The content from these files has been reorganized into the new documentation structure:

- **System Overview** → [docs/architecture/system-overview.md](../architecture/system-overview.md)
- **API Documentation** → [docs/api/endpoints.md](../api/endpoints.md) and [docs/api/external-apis.md](../api/external-apis.md)
- **Database Information** → [docs/database-schema.md](../database-schema.md)
- **Development Guide** → [docs/guides/getting-started.md](../guides/getting-started.md)
- **Deployment Guide** → [docs/guides/deployment.md](../guides/deployment.md)

## Why Archived?

These files were consolidated to:
- **Reduce redundancy** between multiple documentation sources
- **Improve organization** with logical topic-based structure
- **Enhance maintainability** by having single sources of truth
- **Follow industry standards** for documentation structure
- **Improve developer experience** with focused, navigable docs
