● I can see from the conversation summary that the logging functionality for enable/disable social
  profile actions has already been implemented. Let me check the current state of the
  toggle_account_enabled function to confirm the logging is in place.

● Read(app.py)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I can see that the logging functionality for enable/disable social profile actions has
  already been successfully implemented in the toggle_account_enabled() function at lines 488-490. The
  implementation includes:

  - Comprehensive logging that captures account platform, username, and ID
  - Uses the existing log_console() function with 'ACCT' log type
  - Logs both enable and disable actions with proper messaging
  - Uses 'success' level for the log entries

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Add logging for enable/disable social profile actions

● The logging functionality for enable/disable social profile actions has been successfully
  implemented. The system now logs all account toggle actions to the console.log file with detailed
  information including the platform, username, and account ID.

> sorry i stopped you by accident, check what was done and complete if needed

● Let me check what was completed and see if anything needs finishing.

● Read(templates/index.html)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(templates/index.html)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Both tasks were completed successfully:

  1. ✅ Logo added to dashboard header - The logo is now elegantly positioned next to the title with
  proper spacing using flexbox layout
  2. ✅ Footer added with developer credit - Clean footer with "Developed by Niro Knox © 2025" at the
  bottom of the page

  The implementation is minimal and elegant as requested. The logo appears at the top left next to the
  "Social Trigger" title, and the footer is positioned cleanly at the bottom with proper styling.
